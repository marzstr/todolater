Today / Tomorrow allows user to document and prioritize the items they want to accomplish, as well as be able to see the history of all completed items. Having the ability to sort through items and push the items you know you will not be able to complete today, to tomorrow. All uncompleted items default to today's list, therefore the user will constantly be able to arrage their priorities for that day. Having a historical record of completed items, allows for quick scan of when tasks were completed.
